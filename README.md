# minifetch
Smaller version of Neofetch.

Mark install.sh as executable and run it to install. (sudo ./install.sh)

To edit the layout (kinda hard, needs basic bash knowledge), open /usr/bin/minifetch and edit the "$main=(...)" part.

To use Rainbow Text, Install "lolcat".

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install lolcat

ArchLinux: sudo pacman -S lolcat
